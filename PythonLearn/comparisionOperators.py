#Comparison operators, compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is 
#True or False, can be used to compare strings, numbers, booleans, and other objects. 
#there are six comparison operators.
#equality operator, compares tow values and returns Ture if the operands are equal, otherwise False
print(5 == 5)
x = 5 == 5 # can assign comparioson to variable
print(x)
x = "python" == "python" #can use to compare strings
print(x)
#inequality operator, compares two values and retunrs True if the operands are not equal, 
# otherwise retunrs False
print(10 != 5) 
x = 10 != 5 # can assign comparioson to variable
print(x)
x = "python" != "javascript" #can use to compare strings
print(x)
#greater than operator >, returns True if the left operand is greater that the right operand, otherwise False
print(8 > 4)
print(5 > 8)

print(x)
#less than operator <, returns True if the left operand is less than the right opernad, otherwise False

print(x)
#greater than or equal to >= returns True if the left operand is freater than or equal to the right opernad, otherwise returns False

print(8 >= 8)
print(5 >= 10)
#less than or equal to <= retunrs True if the left operand is less than equal to the right operand, otherwise retunrs False.
