    "Basic operators\n",
    "An operator is a symbol of the programming language, which is able to operate on the values.\n",

    "\n",
    "+, -, *, /, //, %, **\n",

    "\n",
    "The order of their appearance is not accidental. We'll talk more about it once we've gone through them all.\n",

    "# Arithmetic operators: exponentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "A ** (double asterisk) sign is an exponentiation (power) operator. Its left argument is the base, its right, the exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical mathematics prefers notation with superscripts, just like this: 23. Pure text editors don't accept that, so Python uses ** instead, e.g., 2 ** 3.\n",
