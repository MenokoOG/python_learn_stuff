    "To make such decisions, Python offers a special instruction. Due to its nature and its application, it's called a conditional instruction (or conditional statement).\n",

    "an indented instruction or set of instructions (at least one instruction is absolutely required); the indentation may be achieved in two ways - by inserting a particular number of spaces (the recommendation is to use four spaces of indentation), or by using the tab character; note: if there is more than one instruction in the indented part, the indentation should be the same in all lines; even though it may look the same if you use tabs mixed with spaces, it's important to make all indentations exactly the same - Python 3 does not allow mixing spaces and tabs for indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How does that statement work?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the true_or_not expression represents the truth (i.e., its value is not equal to zero), the indented statement(s) will be executed;\n",
