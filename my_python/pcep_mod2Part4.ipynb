A legal identifier name must be a non-empty sequence of characters, must begin with the underscore(_), or a letter, and it cannot be a Python keyword. The first character may be followed by underscores, letters, and digits. Identifiers in Python are case-sensitive. (2.1.4.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Python is a dynamically-typed language, which means you don't need to declare variables in it. (2.1.4.3) To assign values to variables, you can use a simple assignment operator in the form of the equal (=) sign, i.e., var = 1.\n",
